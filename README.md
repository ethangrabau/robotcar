# Family Robot Assistant

A smart, voice-controlled robot assistant built on the PiCar-X platform with Raspberry Pi.

## Overview

The Family Robot Assistant is a comprehensive project that integrates various technologies to provide a safe and interactive experience for families. The project leverages the PiCar-X platform, Raspberry Pi, and a range of software components to deliver a robust and feature-rich robot assistant.

## Features

- Voice commands via speech recognition
- Object search and recognition
- Smart home integration
- Face recognition
- Safe, family-friendly interactions

### Voice Commands

The robot assistant supports voice commands via speech recognition, allowing users to interact with the robot using natural language. The speech recognition system is integrated with the robot's movement and navigation systems, enabling users to control the robot's movements and actions using voice commands.

### Object Search and Recognition

The robot assistant is equipped with computer vision capabilities, enabling it to search and recognize objects in its environment. This feature allows users to ask the robot to find specific objects, and the robot will use its vision system to locate and identify the object.

### Smart Home Integration

The robot assistant can integrate with smart home systems, enabling users to control their home's lighting, temperature, and security systems using voice commands. This feature provides a seamless and convenient way to manage smart home devices.

### Face Recognition

The robot assistant features face recognition capabilities, allowing it to recognize and respond to individual users. This feature enables the robot to provide personalized interactions and experiences for each user.

### Safe and Family-Friendly Interactions

The robot assistant is designed with safety and family-friendliness in mind. The robot's interactions are designed to be engaging and educational, while also ensuring the safety and well-being of users.
